## MarvelAPI

This is my project where I fetch an API from Marvel. You can search for characters by their first letter.

I use a validation so the app doesn't show characters that do not have thumbnails. 
Also it is limited to show 60 characters. 
The page is responsible for mobile screens, just using flex-box. 

Hope you like it!
